        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Hogan's Old Paintings was founded in 1997. A family owned business ran and maintained by Hogan and his family to produce and redistribute old paintings to people who need them. We have been recreating and producing old paintings since 1994 and only recently started selling them. All of the members of the family have been in the business for over 20 years creating and selling new and old paintings. We are all major History buffs and love to paint, making this an obvious choice.</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p> We believe in the power of art. We believe in the freedom of expression. We believe in the power of community. We believe in the power of people. These paintings were all of those things back in their time. We want to restore that quality of art and this is one of the best ways be know how. We hope to be able to provide hundreds if not thousands of people with these paintings. We wish to restore this type of art as now art has taken a sharp nose dive.</p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>We are a family owned business. We wish to stay that way. Our dynamic is only amplified with this connection between each other. Our vision is to see hundreds of thousands of old paintings being used by people all around the world. We hope to restore the old art and its meaning to people.</p>
